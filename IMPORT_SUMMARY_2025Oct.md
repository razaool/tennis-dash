## 🚀 Performance Notes

### Why Rating Calculation Was Fast

The existing rating calculation scripts process **all matches chronologically**. Since ratings were already calculated for all historical matches, when you imported the new October matches, the system:

1. Inserted the 62 new matches
2. The rating calculation script (which was already running or ran previously) processed them in chronological order
3. Ratings were calculated based on each player's previous rating before the October tournaments

### Future Imports: Two Options

#### **Option 1: Incremental Calculation** (Recommended for small updates)
```bash
node scripts/calculateELORatings_incremental.js
```
- Only processes matches without ratings
- **Fast:** < 1 minute for 50-100 matches
- **Use when:** Adding 1-2 tournaments

#### **Option 2: Full Recalculation** (For major updates or corrections)
```bash
node scripts/calculateELORatings.js
node scripts/calculateGlicko2Ratings.js
node scripts/calculateTrueSkillRatings.js
```
- Recalculates ALL ratings from scratch
- **Slow:** 5-15 minutes per rating system
- **Use when:** 
  - Adding 100+ matches
  - Fixing data errors
  - Changing rating algorithm
  - Starting a new season

    completed_tournaments = completed_tournaments + 2,
    last_updated = NOW()
WHERE season_year = 2025;
```

## 💡 Key Learnings

### 1. **Player Name Mapping is Critical**
- CSV files use abbreviated names ("Sinner J.")
- Database uses full names ("Jannik Sinner")
- The import script handles this automatically with intelligent matching

### 2. **Incremental Updates are Much Faster**
- Full recalculation: ~15-30 minutes
- Incremental calculation: < 1 minute
- **Always use incremental for small updates**

### 3. **Rating Calculation is Automatic**
- Ratings are calculated chronologically
- New matches automatically get ratings if script has run
- No need to manually trigger for small updates

### 4. **Data Validation is Essential**
- Always check player mapping before import
- Verify match counts after import
- Confirm ratings exist for new matches

## 🔄 Next Time You Import Data

### Quick Reference:

```bash
# 1. Place CSV file in data-source/
cp new_tournament.csv data-source/

# 2. Run import script
node scripts/import_csv_tournament.js data-source/new_tournament.csv

# 3. Import the generated SQL
psql -d tennis_dash -f data-source/new_tournament_import.sql

# 4. Calculate ratings (if needed)
node scripts/calculateELORatings_incremental.js

# 5. Verify
psql -d tennis_dash -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM matches WHERE match_date >= 'YYYY-MM-DD';"
```

**Total time:** < 5 minutes for typical tournament import
