**Problem**: Some players have way more matches
**Solution**:
- Weight samples by inverse frequency
- Stratified sampling
- Focus on recent matches

### Issue 3: Cold Start
**Problem**: New players with no history
**Solution**:
- Use default ratings (1500 ELO)

- Bootstrap from junior/challenger results

### Issue 4: Surface Bias
**Problem**: Model might favor one surface
**Solution**:
- Surface-stratified validation
- Separate models per surface (optional)
- Surface-specific feature weights

### Issue 5: Overfitting
**Problem**: Model memorizes training data
**Solution**:
- Regularization (L1/L2)
- Early stopping
- Cross-validation
- Feature selection

### Issue 6: Concept Drift
**Problem**: Tennis evolves (equipment, training, etc.)
**Solution**:
- Weight recent matches higher
- Retrain model quarterly
